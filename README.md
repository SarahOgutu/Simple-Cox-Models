# Simple-Cox-Models
We applied Cox Proportional Hazards models to assess the impact of longitudinally measured cytokine profiles on HIV incidence. 
Cytokine effects were modeled as averages, differences, and time-dependent covariates and combined with baseline clinical covariates. 
Stepwise regression was used for model selection, and performance was compared using AIC. 
Kaplan-Meier curves were employed to evaluate HIV incidence across treatment arms.
## Project objectives
1. Determine which cytokine biomarkers and baseline characteristics are most strongly associated with HIV incidence.
2. Compare the fitted Cox PH models
## Dataset
The data (CAP004) used for this analysis was obtained from CAPRISA (https://www.caprisa.org/Pages/CAPRISAStudies).
